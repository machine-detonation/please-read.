ive been getting a lot more emotional and i don't feel as safe as i used to. if you aren't a friend of mine i would prefer it if you limited your interaction with me unless if i directly interact with you first (yes this includes "cuddling"). in general i have just been feeling terrible lately and i keep having really bad intrusive thoughts. i have also been getting more upset than i usually do, even at the smallest inconveniences. all i ask is that you watch what you say and do around me. thanks.

also don't try to send me any friend requests unless I send you one first, this is across all games/platforms and is not exclusive to just pony.town.
