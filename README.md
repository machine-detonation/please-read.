ive been getting a lot more emotional and i don't feel as safe around other people and in familiar environments as i used to. if you aren't a friend of mine i would prefer it if you limited your interaction with me unless if i directly interact with you first. in general i have just been feeling terrible lately and i keep having really bad intrusive thoughts. i have also been getting more upset than i usually do, even at the smallest inconveniences. don't try to send me any friend requests unless I send you one first, this is across all games/platforms and is not exclusive to just pony.town. just watch what you say and do around me, please and thank you.



im sorry if I make you uncomfortable or i have in the past. i can seem aggressive or even mean and im sorry.
